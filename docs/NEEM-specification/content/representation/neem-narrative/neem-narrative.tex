\chapter{NEEM-Narrative}
\label{ch:narrative}
\chapterauthor{D. Be{\ss}ler, M. Pomarlan, A. Vyas}

The narrative part of \neems represents a ``story'' of what has happened.
But the story is more detailed then it would be when told from one human to another
as it includes details about movements and interactions that would usually not be spelled out in a human conversation.
The reason to include this type of information is that it is extremely difficult to generalize robotic behaviour, and in particular how the robot needs to move its body to accomplish its goal with varying context such as different environemnts.
The vision is that a library of \emph{contextualized} motions and interactions will help to uncover models underlying everyday activities. In section \ref{sec:episodes}, we discuss contextualization concept which is useful to consider for social interactions. Such as robots performing successful navigation task but failing to consider situational context by ignoring fact that the path it took blocked someone's path. Here, a library of \neems would serve as library of such contextualized motions.

The story represented in the \neemnar provides context for the \neemexp acquired during an activitiy.
This is, first of all, that labels are assigned to the time intervals where something relevant has happened such as the execution of a task, the interaction between objects, or the occurrence of a motion.
Labels correspond to classes that are organized in a taxonomy (Section~\ref{sec:narrative:taxonomy}).
This allows to learn models at different levels of abstraction, 
e.g., for more general or specific variants of a task.
The \neemnar further represents relationships between instances of these classes, such as that an object plays a role during an event, or that a movement has happened as part of executing an action
(Section~\ref{sec:narrative:relations}).

\section{Taxonomy} 
\label{sec:narrative:taxonomy} 

Here in the following section, we will discuss taxonomy for the concepts used to describe \neemnar part. A taxonomy provides the hierarchical relationships among various concepts and defines the terminology for each concept. One way to classify an entity in ontology is through taxonomies, which concentrates on \emph{what there actually is?} as compared to conceptual classification which is more about \emph{how an entity is interpreted?}. For instance, the concepts \textit{spoon} and \textit{knife} are subclasses of the concept \textit{cutlery}.

%\paragraph{Actions} 
 
\subsection{Event}
An \emph{Event} can be described as any physical, social or mental process that occurs or happens. In \dul upper level ontology, an event is considered as \emph{perdurant} entity, which unfolds over time and can have part of it's presence during any given snapshot of time. All though event taxonomy is not the scope of this section, it is important to clear some of the concepts related to event. Such as \emph{what is an event type? Which are the sub-concepts of an event considered for the scope of \neemnar?}. An event has mainly three sub-concepts defined in \soma which are Accident, Action and Process. 

When causes are considered unknown and/or irrelevant for an event then it falls under \emph{Accident} category. It is worth to note distinction between everyday uses of accident definition which concentrates on a causal structure and responsibility for an event, such as who made a mistake bringing about the event; in "traffic accident", where we want to know who is responsible. Such an event does NOT fall under the definition of Accident here. However, when an environment suddenly changes around the robotic agent without any interference from robot such as while cleaning kitchen table, the cupboard mounted on the wall falls-down. Here the questions such as \textit{why the cupboard has fallen-down?} \textit{Is it because the nails holing it were rusted and broke? or because the moisture infiltrated and softened the wall plaster?} By assigning an accident to such event, one can say that we don't know what has caused it or how it can be explained.

An  \emph{Action} can be defined as an event where at least one agent participates, such that this agent performs a dedicated task, defined by a plan or workflow, which it executes through the Action. Here workflow refers to a plan that defines role(s), task(s), and specific structure of tasks that needs to be executed. 

A \emph{Process} is an event for which no such commitments for involvement of an agent have been made. For the scope \soma ontology, we put emphases on process as a top-level class for events with no agentive participant. %we have further categorized process in to chemical and physical processes. For chemical process, by which the chemical constituency of an Entity or set of entities changes. It is safe to assume that any process which results in entities being created or destroyed might fit here, although this concept is specifically intended for events where the chemical reactions are very important occurrence. For physical process it is assumed mostly that the state of an entity will change by involving itself to such process e.g. the cup holding water which goes through pouring process.

An \emph{EventType} describes how an event should be interpreted, executed, expected, and seen which is \emph{definedIn} according to some description \footnote{\url{http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/DUL.owl}}. It is broadly used to classify an event, \emph{ProcessType} and \emph{Task} are some of the EventType sub-classes. An action is an event which is conceptually classified by a Task, similarly Process is an Event which is classified by ProcessTypes.  

\subsection{Task}
\emph{Task} is an \emph{EventType} that classifies an action to be executed. The actions which needs to be taken in order to execute the task are organized according to a Plan, which is however not the same as defining a task. For example task of cleaning a table that can be defined by a plan which is executed by taking several actions. Where as simpler task such as turning left or right can be executed by taking single action. Task can be further classified into three main categories, \emph{PhysicalTask}, \emph{MentalTask} and \emph{CommunicationTask}. 

A task which requires to execute an action through which an agent has to manipulate representations stored in its own cognition can be categorized as \emph{MentalTask}. Dreaming, imagining, prospecting, reasoning, retrospecting falls under mental task. 

\emph{PhysicalTask} requires an agent to perform certain physical activities such as actuating, constructing, modifying physical object, looking at, placing, navigating and perceiving. 

\emph{CommunicationTask} in which two or more agents shares information. This is used to classify special kind of events that have participants as agents. The means of information exchange is physical however the scope of interest here is to  identify which agent communicates and what kind of information it has. 

\subsection{Motions} 
An \emph{EventType} which deals with movements of an agent and motions it makes during task execution. Motion taxonomy includes concepts such as \emph{BodyMovement} which concentrates on the movements of agents body parts. \emph{DirectedMotion} which involves a destination and directed path for an agent to follow. An \emph{UndirectedMotion} is opposite to directed where agent does not have any particular destination but it is important to know that the agent has moved and motion has occurred. And at last \emph{FluidFlow} is the process by which fluid moves or has moved from one location to other.  

\subsection{Roles}
\emph{Roles} are concepts used to describe how an object participates in an event or a relation. An object can play different roles throughout its lifetime. For example, a knife may play the \emph{PatientRole} of a grasping action, i.e. the object mainly affected by the action, and play an \emph{InstrumentRole} in a cutting action. Other roles include \emph{AgentRole}, \emph{CausalProcessRole}, \emph{AnswerRole}, %communication topic, existing object role, explanation, instrument, linguistic function, location, locatum role, path role, patient, question, relatum role, and software type. 
etc. Further role sub-categories will be defined under appendix section.\todo{Seba: An example with using those terms would be nice.}

\section{Relationships}
\label{sec:narrative:relations} 

\subsection{Occurrence}
\label{sec:occurrences}
%% Summary of Figure below
The basic building blocks of \neems are the events that occur when an agent interacts with its environment through movements of its body.
An event is defined as \emph{any physical, social, or mental process, event, or state}. Events have an associated time interval that determines the time at which the event occurs. Time data is represented as unix timestamps using XSD types.
%As discussed in porevious section, we distinguish between three different event classes: \owlClass{Action}, \owlClass{State}, and \owlClass{Process}.

\subsection{Participation}
\label{sec:participation}
%% Summary of Figure below
Events always involve some objects that play a certain role during the event. The role of being the \emph{patient} of some event being an example. This is that the event is directed towards the object. It is not always directly observable what the role of an object might be, however, it is less problematic to just state that the object \emph{has participated} in some event without naming a role.

%\textbf{todo: Sascha write this}
Agents are defined as \emph{agentive objects, either physical (e.g. a robot, a human or a whale) or social (e.g. a corporation, an institution or a community)}, Actions are defined as events with \emph{at least one agent that is participating in it, and that is executing a task}. An example would be an robot that is grasping an object. In that case the robot is the agent and grasping would be the a task executed in an action. Actions can be executed by multiple agents.

\subsection{Composition}
\label{sec:composition}

%\textbf{todo: Mihai write this.}
%\textbf{todo: why isn't hasPhase Event-to-Event?}

Because an Event often has relevant internal structure, it is necessary to represent relations between it and the other events that make up its composition. 
%DUL provides two such structuring relations: \emph{hasConstituent} and \emph{hasPart}. We will focus on \emph{hasPart} in this section, but we will briefly discuss the difference between the two relations as well. \todo{Seba: Why only hasPart ?}
%
%The \emph{hasConstituent} relation is intended to connect entities from different ontological layers or levels of abstraction of looking at the world. A material is a constituent of the object it makes up; individual persons are constituents of a corporation. While these constituency relations could often be in colloquial language described as parthood, DUL reserves parthood for more restrictive connections between entities closer to each other in their ontological characterization. For example, a corporation is a \emph{SocialObject} and as such can only have \emph{SocialObjects} as parts, whereas human persons are \emph{PhysicalAgents}, disjoint from \emph{SocialObjects}.
%
%The \emph{hasPart} relation is transitive and defined to have domain and range \emph{Entity}, that is, in principle it could link entities from any concepts together. However, various concepts restrict what can be parts of their instances as exemplified above; as another example, \emph{PhysicalObjects} can only have other \emph{PhysicalObjects} as parts. In SOMA, we define more specialized subproperties of \emph{hasPart} to deal with parts of \emph{Events} vs. parts of \emph{Objects}. The relevant properties are \emph{hasPhase} and \emph{hasComponent} respectively; both are subproperties of \emph{hasPart}.
%
In SOMA, we define a \emph{hasPhase} property to represent such relations. This is a transitive property, similar to its superproperty in DUL, \emph{hasPart}.

\begin{ODP}{Event Phases}
	\ODPINTENT{To represent how an event is composed of phases.}
	\ODPDEFINEDIN{SOMA.owl}
	\ODPQUESTION{What are the phases of this action? Is this a phase of some action?}

	    \node[owlclass] (E) {Event};
	    \path (E) edge[relation,loop above] node {hasPhase} (E);
	\end{tikzpicture}
	}
	%% Example KnowRob language expressions
	\ODPEXAMPLES{
		\emph{has\_phase($x$,$y$)} &
		$y$ is a phase of $x$
	}
\end{ODP}

%\todo{Seba: For me this section makes sense. However, I have the feeling that compared to the previous sections, this section requires maybe more knowledge in ontologies to be understand. Maybe we should give it to someone how does not have any knowledge about ontologies.}

%\todo{Daniel: I agree, probably we do not need to discuss the distinction between hasConstituent and hasPart here as it does not help the people to generate neems. We should limit to what is necessary here.}

%This ODP allows to make assertions on roles played by agents without involving the agents that play that roles, and vice versa. It allows to express neither the context type in which tasks are defined, not the particular context in which the action is carried out. Moreover, it does not allow to express the time at which the task is executed through the action (for actions that do not solely execute that certain task).

\subsection{Transformation}
\label{sec:transformation}

Objects typically undergo changes by taking part in actions or processes. Such changes typically take one of two forms: either some property of an object changes value, or the object itself modifies its ontological characterization. As an example, a wad of dough being transported from the table to the inside of an oven has changed its position, but is still, at this point, a wad of dough. Left in a hot oven for enough time however, the wad of dough becomes bread.

The variation with time of object qualities has been described in section~\ref{sec:qualification}. The object transformation pattern, described here, handles the changes of an object's ontological classification through time. An immediate problem is that ontological characterizations are necessarily discrete -- there is a finite number of classes an object can belong to -- while change in the physical world is continuous. In the example above, the wad of dough ceases to be dough after a few moments in the oven, because its chemical composition is changing away from the composition of dough. Nonetheless, it is not bread yet.

For practical purposes however, human beings often do not care about the exact classification of an object undergoing ontological change; only the endpoints are important. Also, there is a tendency to loosely apply ontological classification to the changing object, as if it were on either side of the transformation. The cooking wad of dough could be referred to as dough, or it could be referred to as bread. It is both, and neither. While sufficient for causal discourse, such carelessness would not work in a formal system. Hence, the approach in SOMA is to define a class of objects called \emph{Transient}, and it is to this class that objects undergoing ontological classification change belong to. A Transient \emph{transitionsFrom} some object with a specific classification (e.g. \emph{Dough}) and \emph{transitionsTo} another object with a specific classification (e.g. \emph{Bread}). These two relations can be combined into the \emph{transitionsBack} relation, to cover situations where an object changes in essential ways during an event, but returns to being itself after the event completes, such as a catalyst in a chemical reaction.
 
% This pattern addresses the fact that objects change by undergoing/taking part in Processes. For example, the PancakeMix becomes, through Baking, a Pancake. However, the ontological status of the object while the process takes place is unclear: the object placed on the frying pan is not a Pancake until Baking finishes, but it's not PancakeMix either once it begins to coagulate. In the EASE approach, the object in-between such characterizations is a Transient. A Transient transitionsFrom an Object, and possibly transitionsTo an Object. It may also be the case that a Transient transitionsBack to an Object, to indicate that once the process completes, the same Object is restored; this would be the case for example for catalysts in chemistry, or a loaf of bread after slicing, if there is enough bread left.

\subsection{Conceptualization}
\label{sec:classification}

The classification of entities is done from multiple viewpoints.
The most essential one is \emph{what the entitiy really is}.
This is reflected in the taxonomy.
However, entities may further be classified according to social aspects such as intention, purpose, etc.
This type of classification is based on the \emph{conceptualization} of entities.
In particular, conceptualizations of objects and events are used to classify them in the scope of some activity.
For this purpose,
a comprehensive collection of concepts is used to classify objects and events from a conceptual viewpoint (\textbf{todo: insert link to list of all concepts}).

An object that participates in an event usually plays a certain role during the event.
Some objects are designed to be used in certain ways, thus playing certain roles in specific tasks.
This is, for example, a box which is designed to be used as a container to store items.
However, roles may also be taken by objects that are not designed to be used as such.
The box could, for example, also be used as a door stopper, but surely it would be
inappropriate to classify it as such taxonomically.
Instead, roles are defined as concepts that are used to classify the objects that particpate in an event from a conceptual viewpoint.

\begin{ODP}{Object Role}

		$y$ is a role of $x$ \\
		% % % % %
		\emph{has\_role($x$,$y$) during $z$} &
		$y$ is a role of $x$ during the occurrence of $z$
	}
\end{ODP}

The conceptualization of an event is about how it should be interpreted, executed, expected, seen, etc.
One aspect is that a single event may contribute to multiple goals, such as when an ingredient is fetched that is partly used in a step of a cooking recipe, and partly eaten raw to satisfy hunger.
In such a case, the taxonomical category of the event would be unclear in case it should describe the goal to which the event contributes.
Another aspect is that intentions of agents may not always be known such that the classification of events based on their goals is difficult, and different viewpoints on the same event may exist.
Hence, when referring to goals, intentions, etc. we rather employ conceptual classification.
This allows us to represent several different classifications of the same event in one or more situational contexts, for example an interpretations of the same event from different viewpoints.
%\todo{Seba: How the conceptualization of an event looks in the end? Do we have only one classification or can it have multiple classifications if the goal is not clear?}

\subsection{Contextualization}
\label{sec:episodes}

An episode is seen as a \emph{relational context} created by an observer that creates a view on a set of entities such as actions that were perfomed, and objects that played a role. We say that an episode is a \emph{setting for} each entity that is relevant for the scope of the episode. As an example, consider the statement \emph{"this morning the robot made a mess on the floor while preparing coffee"}, where the preparation of coffee in the morning is the setting for the robot, the floor, and the actions that were perfomed.
Several specializations of the general \emph{is setting for} relation exist that can be used to distinguish between entities based on their type -- these are, among others, \emph{includesObject} and \emph{includesAgent}.
However, assuming hierachical organization of objects (i.e. all objects are part of some map), and events (i.e. an event is composed into sub-events) only those entities at the root of the composition (e.g. the map) are required to be included explicitely in the episode.

Episodes refer to concrete occurences with actual objects that are involved, and actual events that occur.
The conceptualization of an episode is an abstraction that refers to concepts instead that are used to classify entities that are included in the episode.
Such conceptualizations are called \emph{descriptions}.
We say that an episode \emph{satisfies} a description in case the view represented
by the episode is consistent with the conceptualization given by the description.
Diagnosis being one example of a description of an episode.
Stating that the performance of the robot was \emph{amateurish} when it made a mess on the floor while
preparing coffee is one example for describing an epsiode.
Another type of descriptions are plans that are used to conceptualize the structure of an activity.

%\begin{itemize}
%  \item AssemblyConnection: two objects are in a rigid connection, such that the movement of one determines the movement of the other. In this case the characterizing Configuration for this State uses several Roles-- one for each part/geometric feature belonging to the connected objects-- and puts constraints on the relative positioning of these geometric features such that they interlock to produce the rigid connection.
%  \item Contact: two objects are in mechanical contact. The characterizing Configuration uses two Roles, one for each participating object, and puts constraints on the Pose qualities of the participants: the poses should be such that the participants touch.
%  \item FunctionalControl: an object restricts the movement of another, at least partially. The Configuration uses the Roles Item and Restrictor. More concrete examples are Containment: the Restrictor is a Container, and the Pose quality of the Item should use the region inside the Container; and Support: both Restrictor and Item are objects, placed in such a way that the Item does not move because of gravity.
%  \item PhysicallyAccessible: the Configuration for this state uses the roles Item, a Container or Protector, and optionally an Accessor and a Task, and states that an Item is either placed in a Container or protected by a Protector, but the placement of the Item and Container is such that an Accessor may nevertheless reach the Item in order to perform a Task. For a more concrete example, a DoorOpen is a kind of PhysicallyAccessible where the Protector is a door, the Item is the inside of the room behind the door, the Accessor is some person and the Task is to walk into the inside of the room.

\begin{ODP}{Designed Artifact}

This allows us to say that an object is ``for'' a particular purpose, even though it might be used for something else instead. For example, a cup is a BeverageContainer but can be used as a Flowerpot. Designs form a hierarchy of specificity, for example $DesignMilkContainer \sqsubseteq DesignBeverageContainer \sqsubseteq DesginContainer \sqsubseteq Design$. The justification for this pattern is that the type of an object is rigid, but the roles it plays in events change. A naive taxonomy, without a notion similar to Design, cannot tackle the fact that objects are usable in several ways beyond the obvious; a hammer isn't always a hammer, sometimes it's a paperweight.

% In version \neemversion the \neemnar consists the belief state and action task hierarchy. 
% In the following sections we will describe how the belief state and action task hierarchy are represented.
% An concrete example for a logged \neemnar will be given in Chapter \ref{ch:example}.

% \subsection{Belief State}
% \input{content/representation/neem-narrative/beliefstate}

% \subsection{Action Hierarchy}
% \label{ch:narrative,sec:actionHierarchy}
% In this section, we will describe how an action task hierarchy is represented in the \neemnar. 
% Since we are using \cram on our robots our plans do not necessary generate a sequence of actions, instead they will generate rather an hierarchy of actions.
% During the plan execution we are logging all executed actions with its parameters and represent the hierarchy in \owl.
% The general idea of the model is that an action will be represented as an individual of the class \owlClass{knowrob:'Action'}.
% This individual can be a direct instance of the class \owlClass{knowrob:'Action'} or its subclass.
% \todo{Add all supported action sub classes}
% With the predicates \owlPredicate{subAction}, \owlPredicate{previousAction} and \owlPredicate{nextAction}, which all have as subject and object the type \owlClass{knowrob:'Action'}, we are able to represent the action hierarchy.
% In our understanding an logged action hierarchy in an \owl represents all actions which were executed during an experiment.
% Meaning, if we would extracted all actions from the \owl file and recreated the action tree, we would be able to analyze and reasoning about all executed actions during one specific experiment.

% In the next subsections we will describe the predicates and classes which we currently defined in the version \neemversion to log the actions which were executed by the robot during an experiment. 

% \subsection{Action Predicates}
% Every individual of the class \owlClass{knowrob:'Action'} class or its subclass which will be logged in the \owl file can be asserted with the following predicates (see Table \ref{table:action_task_predicates}).
% Some predicates in the table are marked as required.
% This means that if you are intending to upload your \owl file to \openease, every \owlClass{knowrob:'Action'} individual has to have the required properties asserted.
% %Otherwise the \owl file will be revoked from the server.\todo{We have to implement such checking in \openease.}
% The \openease server checks also if the objects of the predicates are associated with the correct class.

% \begin{table}[H]
% 	\begin{tabular}{| c | c | c | c |}
% 		\hline			
% 		\textbf{Subject} & \textbf{Predicate} & \textbf{Object}  & \textbf{Required} \\
% 		\hline
% 		Action & taskSuccess & xsd:boolean & Yes \\
% 		\hline
% 		Action & startTime & Timepoint & Yes \\
% 		\hline
% 		Action & endTime & Timepoint  & Yes \\
% 		\hline
% 		Action & subAction & Action & No \\
% 		\hline
% 		Action & nextAction & Action & No \\
% 		\hline
% 		Action & previousAction & Action & No \\
% 		\hline
% 	\end{tabular}
% 	\caption{Action Predicates}
% 	\label{table:action_task_predicates}
% \end{table}

% \begin{description}
% 	\item[\textbf{taskSuccess}] 
% 		This predicates points to data type \owlClass{xsd:boolean}.
% 		The value \textbf{true} represents that the action was executed successfully.
% 		If any errors occurred during the action execution, the data type will be set to \textbf{false}.
% 		\footnote{In the NEEM version \neemversion we do not log the exact error which happened during action.}
% 	\item[\textbf{startTime}]
% 		The \owlPredicate{startTime} represents when the action started.
% 		Instead of representing the startTime as a data point, we are creating an instance of the class \owlClass{Timepoint}.
% 		The implemenation is done in that way because it made writing prolog queries much more convenient. 
% 		The name of the individual is representing the exact time when the action started e.g.\ \textit{timepoint\_1523878415038090} which can be understood that the action started 1523878415038090 microseconds after 00:00:00 UTC, Thursday, 1 January 1970.
% 		We are using the Unix time to represent a time point \cite{matthew2011beginning}.
% 		However, we are considering to measure the time in microseconds.
% 		The reason for this decision is that we also want to create NEEMs in simulation.
% 		However, tasks in simulation can be executed so fast that logging in microseconds allowed to measure the performance of the task executions.
% 		Also the measurement in microseconds allowed to differentiate the running time between tasks.
% 	\item[\textbf{endTime}] 
% 		This predicate represents when the action ended.
% 		More information about how we log time points is described in the predicate description \owlPredicate{startTime}.
% 	\item[\textbf{subAction}]
% 		The predicate \owlPredicate{subAction} allows to create parent-child relation between two tasks. In the context of this predicate, the subject is the parent action and the object is the child action.
% 		It is possible that an \owlClass{Action} instance can have multiple \owlPredicate{subAction} predicates which point each to a single child action.
% 	\item[\textbf{nextAction}]
% 		To be able to create an sequential order of actions which where executed on the same hierarchy level, we defined the \owlPredicate{nextAction} predicate.
% 		The subject represents the action which was started first and points to the next sibling actions.
% 		\footnote{In the NEEM version \neemversion we are not differentiate if actions were executed in sequence or in parallel.}
% 	\item[\textbf{previousAction}]
% 		Like in \owlPredicate{previousAction} this predicate is created to create an sequential order between siblings tasks.
% 		However in this case, \owlPredicate{previousAction} connects an \owlClass{Action} instance with the sibling action which was performed previously.
% \end{description}


% \subsection{Action Parameter Predicates}
% 	\label{sec:actionParameterPredicactes}
% 	In general, actions have to have parameters which have to be asserted.
% 	Based on those assertions \cram is able to infer how to perform the task.
% 	For instance, a grasping task will be executed differently when the target object is a spoon compared to when the target object is a bottle.
% 	To understand the logged behavior of the robot better, we are logging to each action the corresponding parameters.
% 	For \cram we are using for our actions a set of predefined parameters.
% 	For example, when an action requires an object every \cram action has parameter name \textit{object} asserted.
% 	During the logging process, we are creating based on the parameter's value an instance of the class \owlClass{Object} and connect this instance with the \owlPredicate{objectActedOn}.
% 	\todo{Ref to belief state when object description is done}
% 	This implementation allows us to use the logger for new actions without the need to extend the logger.
% 	As long the \cram actions will use the predefined parameter names all parameters will be logged without the need to extend the logger.
% 	All predefined parameters are represented by a separated predicates which point to the parameter value which is an individual of the corresponding \owl class.
% 	Table \ref{table:action_parameter_predicates} shows the current parameter predicates which are supported by our NEEM representation.
% 	The design of the action parameter predicates is based on the work with our \pr.
% 	Therefore in the NEEM \neemversion it might be possible that the action parameters cannot be used by everyone in this state.
	 
% \begin{table}[H]
% \begin{tabular}{| c | c | c |}

% 	\hline
% \end{tabular}
% 	\caption{Action Parameter Predicates}
% 	\label{table:action_parameter_predicates}
% \end{table}

% \begin{description}
% 	\item[\textbf{effort}] 
% 		Effort is the grasping force in newton-meters.
% 		To model this we are using the \qudt ontology \footnote{http://qudt.org/}.
% 	\item[\textbf{position}]
% 		We are using this predicate to log the the goal position for the gripper of the \pr.
% 		The \pr accepts a joint angle in RAD to position its gripper.
% 		We decided to use a float data type to model the position to be able to represent more different types of position.
% 		For instance, our \boxy robot uses centimeters to position the gripper.
% 		Therefore with a float representation we are able to log from both robots the position parameter.
% 	\item[\textbf{arm}]
% 		With this predicate we want to log which arm was used to by the robot.
% 		The predicate points to an instance of the specific robot arm class.
% 		For instance, to model that the \pr used a right arm to grasp a bottle we are asserting the \owlPredicate{arm} predicate to an individual of the class \owlClass{Pr2RightArm}\footnote{http://knowrob.org/kb/PR2.owl}.
% 	\item[\textbf{bodyPartsUsed}]
% 		The \owlPredicate{bodyPartsUsed} predicate should represent which body part from the robot was used to perform the task.
% 		This predicate can be used \eg to represent that a gripper was used to perform the task.
% 		Like in \dots we also want to represent the body part as instance of the class which represents the body part.
% 	\item[\textbf{goalLocation}]
% 		This predicate can be used to represent the target or location parameter of an action.
% 		This predicate is suitable to represent \eg the target location of an \textit{Going} action.
% 		We are considering to different object types to log the goal location.
% 		Since our robots are build on \ros our robots can work with \textit{Poses} \footnote{http://docs.ros.org/api/geometry\_msgs/html/msg/Pose.html}.
% 		How we represent this \owl class is stated out in section \ref{sec:pose}.
		
% 		Since we are also using \cram, our robots can also encounter \textit{location designator} as goal locations\cite{beetz2010cram}.
% 		That means \cram can handle tasks like "Go to the kitchen counter".
% 		Since locations designators are more abstract we use the \owl class \owlClass{Connected Space Region} to log them.
% 		A more detailed description is given in section \ref{sec:connectedSpaceRegion}.
		
% 	\item[\textbf{objectActedOn}]
% 		With the predicate \owlClass{objectActedOn} we want to log which objects are given as parameter to the action.
% 		For instance, we can log which objects the robots looked for during a perception task and what objects he tried to grab.
% 	\item[\textbf{objectType}]
% 		The difference of \owlPredicate{objectType} compared to \owlPredicate{objectActedOn} is that \owlPredicate{objectType} define not a specific object but rather an object in general.
% 		For instance, if the robotic agent will get a task such as "grab the milk from the fridge".
% 		Given the task, the agent knows only that it has to grab a object of the type of milk from the fridge.
% 		So at this moment the robot does not know if the a milk box is actually in the fridge.
% 		Thereofre it has to recognize the milk first.
% 		If this was sucessfull then the robot will assoicated the following task the milk ID with the predicate \owlPredicate{objectActedOn} which the object will be the link to the speicifc object in the belieft state.
% \end{description}

% \subsection{Action Parameter Classes}
% As shown in section \ref{sec:actionParameterPredicactes} we are not only using data types to log the action parameter.
% In this section we are describing the \owl classes which we introduced to be able to log all parameters which we required to log during our experiments.

% \subsubsection{Pose}
% 	\label{sec:pose}
% 	This class is used to log coordinates given as parameter.
% 	Since our robots are using \ros we are logging poses.
% 	A pose consists from a Quaternion and a 3D vector.
% 	Since both together can only describe a Pose, both entities are required to be logged.
% 	\begin{table}[H]
% 		\begin{tabular}{| c | c | c | c |}
% 			\hline			
% 			\textbf{Subject} & \textbf{Predicate} & \textbf{Object} & \textbf{Required}\\
% 			\hline
% 			Pose & quaternion & String & Yes \\
% 			\hline
% 			Pose & translation & String & Yes \\			
% 			\hline
% 		\end{tabular}
% 		\caption{Pose Predicates}
% 		\label{table:pose_predicates}
% 	\end{table}
	
% 	\begin{description}
% 		\item[Quaternion] 
% 			%Quaternions are used to describe rotations in a three dimensionally space. \todo{Set reference to a Quaternions description}
% 			In the NEEM version \neemversion we are representing quaternions as a string.
% 			For instance, the quaternion $0.5 + 0.35i + 1j +0k$ will be represented as "0.5 0.35 1 0".
% 		\item[Translation]
% 			The \owlClass{Translation} class represents the 3D vector part of the pose.
% 			In the NEEM version \neemversion we are representing vectors as a string.
% 			For instance, the vector $\begin{bmatrix} -0.759, 1.19, 0.932 \end{bmatrix}^T$ will be represented as "-0.759 1.19 0.932".
			
			



% 	\end{description}
	
	
	
% \subsubsection{Connected Space Region}
% 	\label{sec:connectedSpaceRegion}
% 	Since we are using \cram our robots are allowed to use location designators to describe location parameters which will be resolved to pose \cite{beetz2010cram}
% 	The resolving process is divided in three stages:
% 		\begin{enumerate}
% 			\item Define a abstract location or general location. For instance, "Grab the milk from the fridge.".
% 			\item \cram will try out to resolve "fridge" to an entity of the semantic map.
% 			\item The last step is to resolve the entity from the semantic map into a pose with which the robot can actually work with.
% 		\end{enumerate}
	
% 	\begin{table}[H]
% 		\begin{tabular}{| c | c | c | c |}
% 			\hline			
% 			\textbf{Subject} & \textbf{Predicate} & \textbf{Object} & \textbf{Required}\\
% 			\hline
% 			Connected Space Region & onPhysical & iai-kitchen & No \\
% 			\hline
% 		\end{tabular}
% 		\caption{Connected Space Region Predicates}
% 		\label{table:connected_space_region_predicates}
% 	\end{table}
	
% 	\begin{description}
% 		\item[onPhysical] 
% 			To be able to represent the resolution to an entity of the semantic map we defined the \owlPredicate{onPhysical} predicate.
% 			This predicate points to an instance of semantic map.
% 			For instance, to grasp an object from the kitchen counter in our kitchen we link the \owlClass{ConnectedSpaceRegion} instance to an individual of our semantic mal in this case \textit{knowrob:iai\_kitchen\_sink\_area\_counter\_top}.
% 	\end{description}

% \subsubsection{Timepoint}
% 	In the NEEM version \neemversion the \owlClass{Timepoint} does not have any predicates.
% 	An instance of the \owlClass{Timepoint} class defines a moment in time which is represented in microseconds.
% 	The exact timestamp in microseconds is represent in the name of the instance.
% 	For example, the individual with the name "timepoint\_1523878419.243441" represents a timepoint which is 1523878419243441 microseconds after 00:00:00 UTC, Thursday, 1 January 1970.
% 	We are using the Unix time to represent a time point\cite{matthew2011beginning}.
% 	This Timepoint represenation makes the prolog quering much more easier.
